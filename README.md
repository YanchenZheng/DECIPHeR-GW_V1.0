# DECIPHeR-GW_V1.0

DECIPHeR-GW is a coupled surface-subsurface hydrological model with improved representation of surface-groundwater interactions. 

The DECIPHeR-GW model is built on the original DECIPHeR model (Coxon et al., 2019) (code available at https://github.com/uob-hydrology/DECIPHeR), DECIPHeR-MPR model (Lane et al., 2021) (code available at https://zenodo.org/records/4646179) and also a large-scale gridded groundwater model (Rahman et al., 2023) (code available at https://github.com/ShamsRahman-Groundwater/Groundwater-model-Code). 

The model has an automated build and is computationally efficient to provide hydrological simulation and prediction including streamflow and groundwater level at large scales. We tested the model and provided examples using data from UK catchments, but the model can be applied to other regions and adapted according to specific hydrologic settings or data availability.

# Documentation
DECIPHeR-GW model is detailed in an open-access paper that will soon be submitted to Geoscientific Model Development. A user manual is also available in the repository to assist researchers and practitioners in using the model.
For any questions regarding usage or running the code, please feel free to contact yanchen.zheng@bristol.ac.uk.
